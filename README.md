# WebSearch  
*A lightweight search and tab manager for Firefox*  

**Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Version:** v1.0.0  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The goal of this project was to create something similar to the **PowerToys Run** function, but tailored specifically for **Firefox**.  
It allows quick searching, tab switching, and bookmark/history access â€” all without leaving the keyboard.  

---

## âœ¨ Features  
- Open results in a **new tab**, not a new window.  
- Minimal, fast **ListView**-based UI.  
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quick access.  
- **Hardcoded constants class** for easy config changes.  
- Search modes: **All**, **Bookmarks**, **History**.  
- **Recent sites** tracking with JSON save/load.  
- Order results by:  
  1. Open tabs  
  2. Frequent tabs  
  3. Bookmarks  
  4. History
  5. Recent Searches
- Command shortcuts (`@o`, `@b`, `@h`, `@f`, `@r`).  
- Auto-select first result on Enter.  
- Website detection for smarter matching.  
- **Launch on startup** with system tray icon.  
- Clean, refactored code structure.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
